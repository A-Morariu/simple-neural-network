# simple-neural-network.py
Creating a simple neural network in Python with one input layer (3 neurons) and one output neuron.

Thanks to Milo Spencer-Harber for this: https://medium.com/technology-invention-and-more/how-to-build-a-simple-neural-network-in-9-lines-of-python-code-cc8f23647ca1

The neural_net.py tries to guess the output given 3 inputs. The solution being: if the first input = 1, the output has to be 1. Otherwise the output should be 0.
